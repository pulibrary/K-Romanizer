[Practice Sheet (HTML)](http://www.princeton.edu/~hyoungl/public/K-Romanizer.html)

As word division must be done manually, it is strongly advised that users get familiarized with the ALA-LC Korean Romanization Table before using K-Romanizer. Otherwise K-Romanizer may yield inaccurate results.

### Troubleshooting
 1) Windows gives a virus warning for any AutoIt-based application including K-Romanizer, which is a false positive. Please consult a local IT staff in order to add K-Romanizer to the safe program list on your work PC.
 2) If K-Romanizer does not work in OCLC Connexion, try to start it by using "Run as administrator."

### Notes
 1) K-Romanizer is a stand-alone executable and no installation is required
 2) K-Romanizer can be used in conjunction with any Windows application.
 3) The icon 韓 was taken from 東國正韻 (Tongguk chŏngun).
